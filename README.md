## Motivation

Many individuals today lead busy lives. Because of that, they find that they are often neglecting important aspects of their well-being such as getting enough sleep, staying hydrated, and engaging in some form of physical activity. Due to long hours of work, it can become a habit to not sleep even the minimum hours needed for staying healthy. It can also become easy to overlook the importance of staying hydrated and maintaining regular physical activity. Our motivation is to provide a solution that empowers individuals to make informed choices about their lifestyles. This can come in the form of reminding them to drink water, providing tips on improving sleep hygiene, or even reminding them to go on a stroll outdoors.

## Goal

Our goal is to create an application that focuses on three important wellness categories: sleep, hydration, and exercise. Poor sleep, inadequate hydration, and lack of physical activity can lead to a range of health issues. Thus, we recognize a need for a comprehensive solution that will address these crucial lifestyle factors and encourage users to make positive choices for their well-being.
